# ReactJS Menu Example Project



## About the project

1. The project was created using React 17.0.2

2. If you're using a new version of React, the API could have changed. If the API has changed, this project will likely break. If you use the same version of React, it should work.

3. The sample was inspired by [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXa0f4-dWi4] React Sidebar Navigation Tutorial. The vidoe uses an older version of React, which doesn't work in version 17.0.2

4. The code doesn't use third party libraries

5. The project doesn't cover unit tests, but you should watch some videos on React Unit testing

## Running the project

1. To start the project in NodeJS run "npm start"

2. To create a build of the website run "npm run build"
